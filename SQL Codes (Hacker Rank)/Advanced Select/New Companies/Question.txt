SQL Query Question with Table Schemas 
Question:
Given the following table schemas, write a SQL query to display the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees for each company. The output should be ordered by the company_code in ascending order. Please note that:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is a string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending order should be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
